# Algorithm Extraction
Load this skill once. Use the instructions to extract algorithms from both Java and Python code fragments before calling record_algorithms tool. Later, the algorithms will be used to compare the logic of two code fragments written in different programming languages to determine if they are clones.

## Extraction Rules - follow this order
1. Start with a single sentence summarizing what the overall code does.
2. Describe every function including the entry point as a FUNCTION block.
3. Inside each FUNCTION block, use numbered plain-English steps only. No syntax from any programming language whatsoever.
4. Preserve all logic exactly - every condition, loop bound, branch, validation check, early exit, and error path must appear.
5. Use generic data structure names only: list, map, set, queue, stack.
6. Do not include comments, type annotations, import descriptions, or any language-specific observations in the algorithm.

## Important Rules:
- Extract Algorithm A from Java first.
- Extract Algorithm B from Python second.
- Only then call record_algorithms tool with both algorithms together.
- Do NOT call record_algorithms tool after extracting just one algorithm.

## After extracting algorithms from both Java and Python code fragments
Pass a JSON string to record_algorithms tool with exactly these keys:

**"java_algorithm"** : the algorithm you extracted from the Java fragment

**"python_algorithm"** : the algorithm you extracted from the Python fragment

## Algorithm Format (plain text only)
Summary: one sentence describing overall behavior.

FUNCTION: 'name'

  1. first step in plain English

  2. second step in plain English
  ...

FUNCTION: 'name'

  1. first step in plain English

  2. second step in plain English
